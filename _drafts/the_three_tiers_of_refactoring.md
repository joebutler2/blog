The more projects I work on the more I notice the need for distinguishing what we mean by "we need to refactor this". In some situations it can be interpreted as "we didn't do the right thing the first time".
Also it matters who is hearing this, from the perspective of non-technical team-member it can be received as a thing that the developers do to no benefit to the team or customers.

My hopes with distinguishing these different kinds, or tiers, of refactoring is to help teams communicate about this process that is critical to grow a product with lesser defects and to actually increase productivity (i.e. velocity for XP practioners)

## Continuous
### i.e. the scouts' rule
When practicing TDD we follow the process of writing a failing test, then writing as little production code as possible to get the test to pass, and finally



## Design Impediment
### i.e. the refactor tractor
