Hey, I'm Joe, a Software Consultant and Coach.

I have been programming professionally for over a decade. Mentoring and teaching other engineers, typically while pair programming, is what motivates me.

Previously I worked at Pivotal as a Staff Software Engineer. We helped Fortune 500 companies & Federal Agencies learn how to build software using modern methodologies and tools. In this role I had the honor of leading several projects; each team was able to build a product that delivered business value and delighted users.

Before that I worked with LivingSocial and saw it grow from an engineering team of \~30 to over 100. From a single monolithic codebase to a Service Oriented Architecture (and yeah, there were couple micro-services in there).

The most fulfilling part of my career has been mentoring. The main impetus for this blog is to share ideas and reflections with others.
