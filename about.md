Hey, I'm Joe, a Staff Software Engineer at Pivotal. We help companies learn how to build software using modern methodologies and tools.Â 

Previously I worked with LivingSocial and saw it grow from an engineering team of ~30 to over 100, from a single monolithic codebase to a Service Oriented Architecture (and yeah, there were couple micro-services in there).

In my current role I've had the honor of leading several projects; each team was able to build a product that delivered business value and delighted users.

The most fulfilling part of my career has been mentoring others. The main impetus for this blog is to share ideas and reflections with others.
